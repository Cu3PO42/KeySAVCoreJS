# KeySAVCoreJS

This is a library for all your Pokémon Generation 6 and 7 breaking needs. It has support for exporting data from Powersaves backups/backups from digital copies, main files as well as battle videos.
Basically, this is the logic part of KeySAV2 rewritten. Data is returned in the form of an object containing all relevant information about the Pokémon.

TypeScript definition files are provided and an [API documentation](http://cu3po42.github.io/KeySAVCoreJS/) is available.

# History

Originally I forked the KeySAV2 project to add some features, since then I refactored the code multiple times, extracted this code from the interface logic, ported it to JavaScript and have eventually rewritten it.
